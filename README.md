# lidar_app

The program controls the motor installed on kmtz and collects data from Sweep v1 (LIDAR).

1. !!! Please, get to know about SWEEP v1 and it's commands (google.com) !!!
2. You're welcome to improve these src codes. This programm is writeen in a very frivolous style. I'll leave it as is :)
3. How to use: there are two ways: you inline args or you do not
   args = commands as they're written in datasheet
   3.1 You inline args
       if you pass parameters when runnig this program, it will send it to `parse_and_send_command`
       there these parameters will be parsed in natural order and sent to SWEEP
       this mode was added to be able do this: `./%THIS_APP% DS_STEP_POINTS`
           so that you can skip any i/o while programm runs and just set all args at the start
   3.2 You do not inline args
       * you start this app
       * you read output and stick to do what it asks for
       * `enter a command` = type command as it's written in datasheet write to console
       * then this command will be send to SWEEP and it will execute it
       * then you can type anoter command
       * type `EXIT` to exit
4. first example
   ```
   ./app
   % wait %
   % when you see it asks you to type a command %:
        MS 05      -> set speed = 5
        ID         -> watch ID
        LR 02      -> set laser rate = 2
        DS 10 1000 -> start scan with rotate step 10 degrees and 1000 points per plane
        EXIT       -> exit
   ```

5. second example
   ```
   ./app DS_10_1000
   SWEEP will do same scan (see prev example) using it's setings from previous run
   ```
